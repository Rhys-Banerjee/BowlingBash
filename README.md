# BowlingBash
A momentum based bowling game. (CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS)

To Do:

- Finish main menu
- Create icons for pin count and time_left

User flow: 

Main menu (check) (also TODO: add a controls guide on the main menu)

   - Levels (check)
        - Pause menu (check)
           - Options menu *can only come after sfx*
