# BowlingBash
A momentum based bowling game. (CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS)

To Do:
- Create an animated rotating background to each level (use shaders as well for VFX)
- Flesh out user interface (custom cursor for mouse, text denoting how many pins are left, win-screen, death screen, main menu)
- Create 60 or so levels
- Music & SFX
